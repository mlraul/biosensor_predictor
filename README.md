# About biosensor_predictor

In this repository you will find the files needed to train a Deep Learning predictive model of transcription factor based biosensors. 

# Available files

- Model_validation_training: the K-Fold Cross Validation technique is applied in order to experiment with the model parameters and validate the model performance. Then, you have the possibility to perform the final training and save the model.
- Bayesian_opt: a bayesian optimization algorithm is applied through the validation technique in order to find an aproximation of the best model parameters.
- Data_codification: functions to make data interpretable for the network.
