# About biosensor_predictor

In this repository you will find the files needed to train a Deep Learning predictive model of transcription factor based biosensors. 

# Available files

- Model_evaluation: the K-Fold Cross Validation technique is applied in order to experiment with the model parameters and validate the model performance.
- Bayesian_opt: a bayesian optimization algorithm is applied through the validation technique in order to find an aproximation of the best model parameters.
- Model_training: the model is trained definitely and then saved.
- Data_codification: functions to make data interpretable for the network.
